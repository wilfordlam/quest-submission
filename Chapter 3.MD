## Chapter 3 Day 1
1. 3 reasons why structs are different form resoruces
- Resoruces cannot be copied 
- Resources cannot be overwritten
- You have to be explicit with Resources on how you use them/moving them. You cannot just leave them dangling at the end of the code

2. Resources are extremely useful for NFTs (makes sense since the FLOW ecosystem currently revovles mainly NFTs). This allows for easier tracking of digital ownership to see if NFTs are transferred or created

3. create

4. Transaction

5. Jacob

6. Erorrs:
- Jacob should be @Jacob
- Code should say let myJacob <- create Jacob()
- Missing the "move" operator "<-" after "return"

References are useful because they allow you to interact with resources without having to move them around
