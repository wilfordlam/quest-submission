## Chapter 1 Day 1
1. Blockchain ia a open, decentralized, share database that allows for information to be viewed publicly. The 2 largest blockchians by market cap are Bitcoin and Ethereum. In this cousrse we will focus on the FLOW blockchain that powers then entire FLOW ecosystem and it's dApps
2. A smart contract is a digital contract that is powered by the primary coding language of a specific blockchain. Having smart contracts built in dApps allows for transactions to be automated, thereby eliminating the middle man which further reduces take rates vs many Web2 platforms like Meta, Instagram, Spotify, and so on.
3. A transaciton is what the smart contract is executing. Therefore, when the transaction occurs there tends to be gas fees and other execution fees layered on top for the transction to be executed. Whereas, a script is used to VIEW the blockchain. A script cannot alter the code and therefore, is free

## Chapter 1 Day 2
### 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars
1. Security: Although every smart contract has their own layer of security, Cadence accomplishes that with its strong type system, separation between contracts and transactions, and resource oriented programming
2. Clarity: The code is easy to read. This is made possible by allowing the developer to express their intentions directly
3. Approachability: It's rather easier to learn, so Web2 developers should be able to transition seamlessly
4. Developer experience: The developer can debug issues in an easy manner
5. Resource Oriented Programming: This is by far the most important concept in Cadence. This was created by Dapper Labs when Cadence was created, partially because of their focus on NFTs. This allows for things called "Resources" to be defined in Cadence. 

### Why could the 5 pillars be useful
1. Security is everything. When you launch a dApp onto the mainnet, you want things to work perfectly. Within the crypto world, there are so many scams and hacks. You don't want the users of your application to have a poor user experience, or worst yet, lose their digital asssets due to some security issue
2. Making the code clear and easy the read allow for other developers to come in and build on top of it. It also allows for changes to happen in the future if you developer decies to modify the code
3. One of the biggest hurdles is for Web2 developers to learn a completely new language (ie. Solidity). With Cadence, it's similar to many of the languages used in Web2 which can help with adtoption, consequently increasing the projects built within the FLOW ecosystem
4. Debugging is a must. With Cadence and the FLOW ecosystem still being rather new, we expect there to be issues down the road. Therrefore, having the ability to quickly resolve issues builds trust within your ecosystem
5. Resources are KEY! It unlocks a layer of composability that is just not present within other EVM options, making it a perfect fit for digital assets. By labelling something as a "Resource", this lets the network know that this data structure represents something of tangible value and all code that interacts with this "Resource" is required to follow a set of strict rules.

### I'm super bullish on FLOW and actually wrote a short blog. Feel free to check it out :) https://wilfordlam.medium.com/flow-sleeping-giant-f25b7aecb9aa
